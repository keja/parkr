##Parkr
Parkr is an innovative web-app that aims to simplify and remove the pain from parking in Odense, by removing such ancient concepts like "paper tickets" and "setting the parking disc".

Made for the Spring 2016 EAL Hackathon project where we had 4 days to make a prototype

##How Parkr creates value
Parkr was envisioned with a single goal in mind: Make it faster and more convenient to park in Odense. To do this, we thought of a lot of really cool features:
* Parkr is an app! Paying for parking through your phone means less paper waste, no more forgetting to set your parking disc, and much more.
* Easily see a countdown of exactly how many hours and minutes you have left.
* Extending your parking duration is as simple as clicking one button - even when you're not physically near your car.
* Parkr gives you notifications when your parking is about to expire, and you can even choose when to get them.
* Forgot where you parked? Parkr shows you your parking spot on a map - and it shows your location, too.
* Have more cars or more credit cards? No worries, Parkr can keep track of as many as you want.
* See a history of all of your previous parkings, ordered by newest to oldest

Another idea that we did not implement is smart notifications:
* Parkr knows your location and the location of your car, and Google knows a bunch about streets and, importantly, how long it takes to walk from one location to another. Parkr would then be able to use this information to give push notifications when your parking is close to expiring, but taking into account the amount of time it will take for you to walk to your car.

##Usage - IMPORTANT
Our Parkr prototype was developed with Android as the target platform. Please use Chrome or Firefox on an Android phone when visiting our prototype.

Before you can use our prototype, you need to trust our self signed SSL certificate:
* Visit https://188.166.1.167 
* Choose to continue to the site
* You might have to tap "Advanced" or something like that to be able to do this
* You will now be redirected to Parkr.

If this step is not completed all connection from the web-app will not get sent to the server. Thank you.
