##Parkr
Parkr is an innovative web-app that aims to simplify and remove the pain from parking in Odense, by removing such ancient concepts like "paper tickets" and "setting the parking disc".

Made for the Spring 2016 EAL Hackathon project where we had 4 days to make a prototype

##Usage - IMPORTANT
Our Parkr prototype was developed with Android as the target platform. Please use Chrome or Firefox on an Android phone when visiting our prototype.

Before you can use our prototype, you need to trust our self signed SSL certificate:
* Visit https://188.166.1.167 
* Choose to continue to the site
* You might have to tap "Advanced" or something like that to be able to do this

If this step is not completed all connection from the web-app will not get sent to the server. Thank you.

Now you should be good to go! Visit https://noviks.dk/app/index.html to try our prototype.
